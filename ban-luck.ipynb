    "# Ban Luck - Using Reinforcement Learning to Squeeze your Relatives Dry\n",

    "## What is Ban Luck?\n",
    "In Southeast Asia (SEA), a Chinese New Year (CNY) tradition is to play Chinese Blackjack (Ban Luck) as a social activity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The game is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![How to Play?](assets/how_to_play.png \"How to Play?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**But you don't want to leave it down to luck, you want to \"huat\" (Be prosperous), so how do you squeeze every penny out of your relatives?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## A typical strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Algorithm\n",
    "As a player, when it is my turn, I follow the following algorithm:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Loop until Hold or Reveal:\n",
    "  Let value = Hand value\n",
    "  if value == 21 or value >= 17:\n",
    "    Hold\n",
    "  else:\n",
    "    Draw\n",
    "  if hand has 5 cards:\n",
    "    Reveal\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As a dealer, I would follow a similar algorithm but instead of holding, I would reveal hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feels simple, and based on vibes, it seems sound!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benchmarking\n",
    "But let's simulate some games with this algorithm and see how well it actually performs. \n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, \n",
    "- Let's assume everyone uses this algorithm.\n",
    "- For all our runs unless otherwise stated, we will stick to 8 players (Including dealer)."
